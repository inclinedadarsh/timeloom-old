## Introduction

Timeloom is a web application that allows users to document their technical journey on the activity timeline-style page and showcase it to the world. The main objective is to make it easier for users to document their successes and failures easily.

I started building this application as a part of Buildspace's Nights and Weekends S4 program. Currently, this is in the building phase, and I have launched the waitlist for the beta version. The whole application will be open source, and I am building it in public. The waitlist and the toy version are available at [Timeloom on Vercel](https://timeloom.vercel.app/).

## Technologies

The Timeloom project is built using the following technologies:

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

## Project Status

As mentioned earlier, this project is currently in the Build Phase. You can have a basic idea of what the final application is going to be like by looking at the toy version. The waitlist is up and running, and you can sign up for the beta version.
