## Introduction

Timeloom is a web application that allows users to document their technical journey on the activity timeline-style page and showcase it to the world. The main objective is to make it easier for users to document their successes and failures easily.

I started building this application as a part of Buildspace's Nights and Weekends S4 program. Currently this is in building page and I have launched the waitlist for the beta version. Whole application will be open source and I am building it in public. The waitlist and the toy version is available at https://timeloom.vercel.app/

## Technologies

-   Next.js
-   Tailwind CSS
-   TypeScript

## Project Status

As mentioned earlier, this project is in Build Phase. Basically, you can have a basic idea of what the final application is going to be like by looking at the toy version. The waitlist is up and running and you can sign up for the beta version.

As of now, I am not accepting any contributions. Once the beta version is launched, I will be accepting contributions from the community.

## Room for Improvement

As of now, I am looking forward to launching a beta version with basic features such as creating an account and creating a page where user can add, edit or delete any log. Once the beta version is launched, I will be looking forward to add more features and improve the application. You can look at the possible features in the [project board](https://github.com/users/inclinedadarsh/projects/1).

If you have any suggestions, please feel free to participate in the [discussions](https://github.com/inclinedadarsh/timeloom/discussions). I would love to hear your thoughts.
